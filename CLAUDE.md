## This fork (kzaoaai/paperless-gpt)

AGENTS.md above is upstream's guide, kept verbatim so upstream merges stay clean. This section
covers only what differs in the fork and how it is deployed. Upstream ships CLAUDE.md as a
symlink to AGENTS.md; here it is a regular file — on a sync conflict, keep this file.

### Build, test, deploy

- Build the frontend before any Go build or test: the binary embeds `web-app/dist`
  (`embedded_assets.go`). `cd web-app && npm install && npm run build`, then
  `go vet ./... && go test ./...` from the repo root.
- Run the whole package. `TestTokenLimitInCreatedDateGeneration` panics when run on its own
  (it relies on a template another test sets) — an upstream test-isolation bug.
- CI (`.github/workflows/docker-build-and-push.yml`) is the fork's own: one amd64 build that
  pushes `ghcr.io/kzaoaai/paperless-gpt:latest` and `:<sha>` on every push to `main`, plus
  `workflow_dispatch`. No arm64, manifest-merge or E2E jobs — AGENTS.md's CI section does not
  apply here.
- A push never deploys. Production runs the image as one service of a Komodo-managed compose
  stack (UI-defined: Komodo's DB is the master copy of the compose). Deploy = change the
  compose in Komodo if config changes, write the identical file on the host, then pull and
  recreate only this service with `docker compose -p <project> pull paperless-gpt` and
  `docker compose -p <project> up -d --no-deps paperless-gpt`. Never redeploy the whole stack
  for this: it also pulls paperless-ngx, which tracks a moving tag.

### Syncing upstream

- `git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/main` — merge, never rebase (history is shared
  with origin). Build and test before pushing; the push is what publishes `:latest`.
- Re-check these fork deltas after every sync:
  - The CI workflow above — keep the fork's single build job.
  - `getSuggestedCreatedDate` passes the document's current created date as template key
    `CreatedDate`. Upstream lacks it; production's custom created-date prompt depends on it,
    and a missing map key renders as empty with no error. Guarded by
    `TestCreatedDatePromptReceivesOriginalCreatedDate`.
  - `PDF_UPLOAD_MODE=version` (not upstream yet): `UploadDocumentVersion` in `paperless.go`,
    `uploadProcessedPDFAsVersion` and `versionUnconfirmedError` in `ocr.go`, `UploadMode` on
    `OCROptions`/`OCRRun`, and the Playground/Activity wording in `web-app/src/components/ocr/`.
    Tests: `ocr_version_upload_test.go`. Upstream edits to `uploadProcessedPDF` or
    `ProcessDocumentOCR`'s upload switch will conflict here.
  - `GetTaskStatus` normalizes paperless-ngx's three `/api/tasks/` reply shapes (bare object,
    list, 3.0's paginated envelope) and statuses are compared case-insensitively. Upstream
    still reads a flat object, which on 3.0 makes `PDF_REPLACE` delete originals early.
    Guarded by `task_status_test.go`.
  - Once paperless-ngx confirms a new version (`ProcessedDocument.VersionAdded`),
    `saveVersionText` (`version_text.go`) writes the recognized text into the new version and
    into the original, content only (`SetDocumentContent`, `paperless.go`). A new version's
    content is paperless-ngx's own extraction of the searchable PDF, and paperless-ngx 3.0
    rebuilds a document's search index entry from its ORIGINAL's content on every update
    (`DocumentViewSet.update` → `add_or_update` without effective content). Called after a
    manual OCR job (`processJob`, `jobs.go`) and in the auto-OCR loop (`background.go`).
    Tests: `version_text_test.go`.
  - A digital PDF whose own text already holds the recognized text keeps it: no version, and
    the auto loop leaves its content alone (`keepsExistingText`, `existing_text.go`; PDF action
    `kept`). "Digital" means no page is covered by an image (`pdfrender.PageText`); "holds"
    means 90% of the recognized words, overall and in each script with 3+ words, so missing
    Arabic cannot hide behind English. Tests: `existing_text_test.go`.
  - `go.mod` replaces `github.com/gardar/ocrchestra` with the kzaoaai/ocrchestra fork
    (branch `feat/unicode-text-layer`) for the Unicode text layer. Keep the `replace` when
    upstream moves ocrchestra; rebase the fork branch onto the new version instead. Guarded by
    `textlayer_test.go`.

### Production invariants (config, not code)

- `PDF_UPLOAD=true` with `PDF_UPLOAD_MODE=version`, `PDF_REPLACE=false`: the Document AI
  searchable PDF becomes a new version of the same document. Never switch to `new` mode:
  it uploads a second document, and with replace it deletes the original along with its
  custom fields, document type, storage path and ASN.
- The text layer is drawn with ocrchestra's `pdfocr.UnicodeFont` (`textLayerFont`,
  `textlayer.go`), from the kzaoaai/ocrchestra fork (`replace` in `go.mod`). Upstream's
  default core font encodes only Latin-1 and turns Arabic into mojibake, which paperless
  would extract as the document's text. `unencodableWords` still skips the searchable PDF
  for any word with a character the layer cannot encode (beyond Unicode's Basic
  Multilingual Plane, e.g. emoji); a character the font merely has no glyph for (CJK, Thai,
  …) still extracts as itself and is kept. Never drop the `replace` or the font setting
  while upstream ocrchestra lacks the Unicode layer.
- `PDF_SKIP_EXISTING_OCR=true` only recognizes a text layer ocrchestra itself drew (an optional
  content group named `OCR Text`), i.e. a document paperless-gpt already versioned; it does not
  look at text. Digital PDFs and other tools' OCR layers are handled by the `kept` rule above.
- paperless-ngx's OCR mode (UI Settings → OCR; its database value overrides
  `PAPERLESS_OCR_MODE`) must stay `auto`. paperless parses every new version; under `redo`
  it would re-OCR it with Tesseract and search would use that text instead of the layer.
- `PUID`/`PGID` equal to the owner of the bind-mounted host dirs (1000). The entrypoint
  `chown -R`s `/app` to PUID:PGID (default 10001), which rewrites bind-mounted host dirs.
- Custom prompt templates are mounted over `/app/prompts` and replace `default_prompts/`, so
  template data keys are a contract: renaming or dropping one silently blanks it.
- `OCR_PROCESS_MODE=pdf` downloads the original file and splits it with pdfcpu, so non-PDF
  originals (photos, `.eml`, Office files) cannot be OCR'd. paperless-ngx workflows give the
  OCR trigger tag only to `*.pdf`; everything else goes straight to the LLM stage.
  `OCR_MAX_RETRIES` fail-tags anything that still slips through.
- `/app/db` (modification history and the OCR Activity sqlite) is a bind mount — keep it.

### Open items

- Upstream PR candidates: the `GetTaskStatus` fix (small, fixes data loss for any
  `PDF_REPLACE` user on paperless-ngx 3.0) and `PDF_UPLOAD_MODE=version` (fixes the
  limitation upstream's README describes under "PDF Upload to paperless-ngx").
- `new` upload mode still copies no `document_type`, `custom_fields`, `storage_path` or
  `archive_serial_number` to the new document (`uploadProcessedPDF`, `ocr.go`); `version`
  mode avoids the problem because metadata never leaves the document.
- In the auto-OCR loop (`background.go`), a failed searchable-PDF upload still completes the
  run: the Document AI text is saved, the document leaves the OCR queue and the LLM stage
  runs; only the Activity entry shows "Searchable PDF failed". Deliberate: retrying would
  re-run Document AI and end in `paperless-gpt-failed` without LLM filling.
- `app_llm_googleai.go` treats a Gemini candidate with no content parts as an error. For tag
  generation on text where no existing tag fits, Gemini returns nothing, so the document is
  fail-tagged after `AUTO_TAG_MAX_RETRIES`. Treating an empty tag answer as "no tags" would
  avoid that. Not requested yet.
- `pdf` mode could send non-PDF originals to one whole-document OCR call (as `whole_pdf`
  does) instead of failing. Currently handled by the workflow routing above.
- A version paperless-ngx has not confirmed within 5 minutes keeps paperless-ngx's own
  `pdftotext -layout` reading of the text layer (which misplaces signs and spaces next to
  numbers in right-to-left lines), and search keeps the original's text: a manual job then
  writes no text (its run shows a warning), and the auto loop's content update may land on
  the document before the version exists.
- ocrchestra fork (`feat/unicode-text-layer`): upstream PR candidate. It also fixes gdocai's
  inverted boxes for sideways text.
- `gofmt -l .` lists several upstream files; leave them to upstream.
